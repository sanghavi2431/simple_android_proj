But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</string>

    <string name="info_ovulation"><b>Understanding Your Ovulation Cycle:</b>

        \n\n<b>Signs of Ovulation:</b>

\nIncreased cervical mucus (clear and stretchy).
\n1.Mild abdominal pain (mittelschmerz).
\n2.Elevated basal body temperature.
        \n\n<b>Timing for Conception:</b>
        \nThe fertile window is typically six days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself.

        \n\n<b>Tips for Tracking Ovulation:</b>

\n1.Use ovulation predictor kits for accurate tracking.
\n2.Monitor changes in your body.
\n3.Maintain a healthy lifestyle to support reproductive health.</string>


    <string name="info_high_fertility"><b>Understanding Your Pregnancy Cycle:</b>
        \nThe pregnancy cycle typically lasts about 40 weeks and is divided into three trimesters.

        \n\n<b>First Trimester (Weeks 1-12):</b>
        \nThis is a crucial period for fetal development.
        You may experience symptoms like nausea, fatigue, and mood swings.
        Its important to schedule your first prenatal visit during this time.

\n\n<b>Second Trimester (Weeks 13-26):</b>
        \nOften considered the easiest trimester, many women experience increased energy and reduced nausea.
        This is the time for routine screenings and ultrasounds.

        \n\n<b>Third Trimester (Weeks 27-40):</b>
        As your body prepares for labor, you might feel more discomfort. Regular check-ups will monitor your and your baby’s health.

\n\n<b>Tips for a Healthy Pregnancy:</b>

\n1.Stay hydrated and maintain a balanced diet.
\n2.Attend all prenatal appointments.
\n3.Engage in safe physical activities.
\n4.Consider joining prenatal classes for support and education.</string>

    <string name="info_menstruation"><b>Understanding Your Menstruation Cycle:</b>
        \nThe average menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days, but it can vary from 21 to 35 days.
        Tracking your cycle helps in understanding your body’s rhythms.

\n\n<b>Menstrual Phase (Days 1-5):</b>
        \nThis is when you have your period, and the lining of the uterus sheds.

        \n\n<b>Follicular Phase (Days 1-13):</b>
        \nHormones stimulate the growth of follicles in the ovaries, leading to the maturation of an egg.

        \n\n<b>Ovulation (Day 14):</b>
        \nAround the middle of your cycle, the matured egg is released, which is the optimal time for conception.

\n\n<b>Luteal Phase (Days 15-28):</b>
        \nIf the egg isn’t fertilized, hormone levels drop, leading to the next menstrual phase.

        \n\n<b>Tips for Managing Your Cycle:</b>

\n1.Keep track of your cycle to anticipate symptoms.
\n2.Stay active and maintain a balanced diet.
\n3.Use pain relief methods if you experience cramps.</string>
